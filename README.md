# islandora_ezid

An EZID Archival Resource Key (ARK) management interface for Islandora.

### Introduction

A rough plan, sure to be revised and revised again...

* _Stage 1:_ An administrative UI for batch ARK reservations.  []
* _Stage 2:_ An administrative UI for managing/minting reserved ARKs.  []
* _Stage 3:_ An object page redirect for ARKs.  []
* _Stage 4:_ A resolution mechanism for having ARKs in system URLs.  []

*Open Questions:*

* Allow more than one shoulder to be minted and managed?
* How to do "Stage 4" generically? A different module?  Or Pathauto + something custom for ARKs?
* Multisite vs. single Drupal.  Some way for this to sit at root and work with multisites?
* Should ARK objects be able to be put in more than one collection in the ARK manager?
